Editing: Edit either with protege or with a text editor.
Please make sure that you produce the smallest diff possible for your changes, e.g. don't use a tool that shuffles the definition locations around or changes line endings or indentation.

Verfify after editing with "xmllint --noout filename.rdf" and "rapper -i rdfxml -c filename.rdf".
