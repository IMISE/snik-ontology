# Problem
Our ontology is manually created by people reading text books and extracting their facts to spreadsheets, from now called on "tables".
As our final representation format is RDF/OWL, and there are thousands of rows extracted from each textbook, we need an automatic conversion method.
Because we think it is easiest to process tables in the plain text, comma separated value format CSV, we call this task "CSV2RDF".
If we could choose the format of the tables freely, the task would be trivial, as we could define a mapping from CSV to RDF with a table containing one triple per row with three columns containing subject, predicate and object.
In that case we could also just let our extractors use RDF directly, but they are no RDF specialists

Tension between three criteria:

1. closeness to RDFâ€”less development effort, less
2. intuitiveness for the extractor
3. dfd

 so we want to hide it's complexity .
