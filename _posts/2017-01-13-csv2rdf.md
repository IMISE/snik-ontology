title: Converting Tables to RDF/OWL Ontologies (Draft)

# Problem
The SNIK ontology consists of the central meta ontology and several subontologies.
Each subontology is manually created by people reading text books and extracting their facts to spreadsheets, from now on called "tables".
As our final representation format is RDF/OWL, and there are thousands of rows extracted from each textbook, we need an automatic conversion method.

For our existing subontologies<sup name="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>, we used a specifically developped tool called [Excel2OWL](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27577406).
Its advantages are that it:
- specifies an intuitive table input format that doesn't require RDF/OWL knowledge from the extractors and
- validates the input and warns about certain inconsistencies with the meta ontology

Its disadvantages are that:
- The input format is hard coded and only works for a very specific case, thus
- it is time consuming to implement an improved modelling method and
- it is not easyily adaptable to new subtasks, especially as
- it is not maintained anymore, thus there will be no more bugfixes or updates.

Instead, we are going to use a more flexible approach where we use the generic SPARQLify CSV rewriter tool that provides the SML mapping language. This has the advantages that

- The development time is massively reduced (writing a mapping configuration vs developing a whole tool).
- No maintenance is necessary.
- SML is very close to SPARQL, so resulting RDF can be modelled very intuitively and little extra training is necessary.
- SPARQLify is open source and the developer is very responsive to requests for help or new features.

and the disadvantages that

- The mapping languing is less expressive than a full-fledged programming language, thus
- the input format needs to be more closely aligned to RDF/OWL, thus
- the extractors need a basic knowledge of RDF/OWL.
- We need to validate the input separately.
- SPARQLify is a research prototype made in part time by a single (even though very talented and enthusiastic) developer, not industrial strength software made by a large team. Thus, setting it up is a bit tricky and a few workarounds are necessary.

Due to the major saving of time and the increased flexibility, we decided to use SPARQLify CSV for our upcoming subontologies.
Providing a basic level of RDF/OWL knowledge is useful is useful anyways, because it helps the extractors understand, wheter the process captures what they actually intent to model.
This gap was especially problematic for `owl:someValuesFrom` existential restrictions, which were always generated for all triples using meta ontology properties by Excel2OWL, even though the actual intention of the extractor may have been something different, like a universal `owl:allValuesFrom` quantifier or a direct connection between the classes.


<!--
If we could choose the format of the tables freely, the task would be trivial, as we could define a mapping from CSV to RDF with a table containing one triple per row with three columns containing subject, predicate and object.
In that case we could also just let our extractors use RDF directly, but they are no RDF specialists

There is a tension between (1) the closeness to RDF/OWL and (2) the intuitiveness for the extractor.
(1) results in less mapping effort, more modelling freedom and less nunances lost in translation
while
(2) means less initial training, faster extraction and less modelling errors.
Further criteria for the tool we are looking for are (3) time for initial setup or development (4)

# Related Work

[Ermilov, Auer, Stadler](http://svn.aksw.org/papers/2013/ISemantics_CSV2RDF/public.pdf) used SPARQLify CSV to transform almost 10000 datasets with a total 7.3 billion triples for the [publicdata.eu](http://publicdata.eu/) data portal.
[Ermilov, Höffner, Lehmann](http://svn.aksw.org/papers/2015/SEMANTICS_ITMOLOD_DEMO/public.pdf) used SPARQLify to transform parts of the database of ITMO university, Saint Petersburg.

# Setup of SPARQLify CSV

As I had a few questions and wasn't sure which [branch or release](https://github.com/AKSW/Sparqlify) to check out, I met [Claus Stadler](http://aksw.org/ClausStadler.html), the developer of [SPARQLify](http://sparqlify.org/), a friend and colleague from AKSW.

As I don't have admin rights on my work computer, I installed it via `mvn clean install`, which took more than 12 minutes.
README says to do `mvn assembly:assembly` afterwards but that is broken right now, so we create the command ourselves (replace paths accordingly):

```
echo `java -cp /insert/path/to/sparqlify/sparqlify-cli/target/sparqlify-cli-0.8.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar org.aksw.sparqlify.csv.CsvMapperCliMain -h $@` > ~/bin/sparqlify
chmod +x ~/bin/sparqlify
```

The `-h` parameter says that our first row consists of table row headers for identification.

Now we can test it with:

```
sparqlify -c sparqlify-examples/src/main/resources/sparqlify-examples/csv/example1.sml -f sparqlify-examples/src/main/resources/sparqlify-examples/csv/example1.csv
```

If successfull, this generates some logging messages and ends with:

```
<http://example.org/hello> <http://example.org/name> "hello" .
<http://example.org/hello> <http://example.org/age> "world" .
<http://example.org/hello> <http://example.org/email> "bar" .
<http://example.org/hello> <http://example.org/isPositive> "true"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#boolean> .
<http://example.org/hello> <http://example.org/gender> "foo" .
Variable	#Unbound
Triples generated:	5
Potential triples omitted:	0
Triples total:	5
```

Now want to apply it to our own data and take look at the first few rows including the headers, where we removed spaces to use them in the [SML Mapping Language](http://sparqlify.org/smlLanguage):

As SPARQlify cannot guess the prefixes of our entites, we had to provide them in the "Relation" column.
For SubjektUri, Subjekttyp, Relation and Objekt and Kapitel, we don't need prefixes though because they always imply the local (default) prefix, which we can add in the mapping.
It does not support already prefixed URIs and embraces them like `<rdfs:subClassOf>`.

The SML file, which specifies the mapping for a specific table format, is surprisingly simple and needs only minor adaptions for future subontologies:

```
PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX skos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#>
PREFIX he: <http://www.snik.eu/ontology/he/>
PREFIX meta: <http://www.snik.eu/ontology/meta/>

Create View Template test As
  Construct {
    ?s  a owl:Class;
        meta:subTopClass ?st;
        rdfs:label ?lde, ?len;
        skos:altLabel ?lade, ?laden;
        ?p ?o;
        he:page ?pd;
        skos:definition ?d;
        he:chapter ?ch.
  }

With
    ?s = uri(he:, ?SubjektUri)
    ?st = uri(meta:, ?Subjekttyp)
    ?lde = plainLiteral(?SubjDe,"de")
    ?len = plainLiteral(?SubjEn,"en")
    ?lade = plainLiteral(?SubjAltDe,"de")
    ?laen = plainLiteral(?SubjAltEn,"en")
    ?p = uri(?Relation)
    ?o = uri(he:,?Objekt)
    ?pr = typedLiteral(?SeiteRelation,xsd:positiveInteger)
    ?d = plainLiteral(?Definition,"de")
    ?pd = typedLiteral(?SeiteDefinition,xsd:positiveInteger)
    ?ch = uri(he:,?Kapitel)
```

We execute this mapping and filter out debug messages with:

`sparqlify 2>&1 -c heinrich.sml -f htest.csv > heinrich.nt  | egrep -v "(TRACE)|(DEBUG)"`

This results in 8729 triples from our 1439 rows long test table, which is a preliminary excerpt of the ongoing extraction of the new "Heinrich" (he) ontology.

We now have a large part of the transformation solved with minimal effort, compared to the months-long .
