# Abstract
We used (LIMES)[] to find links between similar concepts in the SNIK subontologies.
110 exact label matches and 149 similar label matches.
Compared to the 80 existing manually created links, 62 were rediscovered as an exact match, 1 was rediscovered as an similar match, 17 were not found again, which leaves 48 new exact matches and 148 new similar matches.
The new links need manual verification and closeless rating through choosing between `skos:exactMatch`, `skos:closeMatch` and so on ([see SNIK wiki](https://wiki.imise.uni-leipzig.de/Projekte/SNIK/ontologie/extraktion/relationen)).

# Problem
The SNIK ontology consists of the central meta ontology and several subontologies.
While the meta ontology contains central terms that are used by nearly all subontologies, some terms are only used by several of them or they have slightly different meanings or are not central. 
In these cases, we modelled those terms as separate classes in each of the subontologies.

As the extractions are done by different people, the information, that those classes are related, was initially missing.
Identifying those relations, called interlinks, allows us at the SNIK project to compare linked concepts to find differences and similarities between the subontologies and thus the different textbook sources. 
After the SNIK project is finished and hopefully widely used, they enable integrating data from hospitals that use different subontologies.

At first, our domain experts manually created 80 links between the bb (blue book) and the ob (orange book) subontologies.
Next, we wanted to automatically generate further candidates, that is possibly related pairs of classes that have to be manually verified.

There are two types of tools for this task:

1. ontology alignment, or ontology matching, where the alignment denotes the set of all computed interlinks (here also called *correspondances*

[Ontology Matching, Euzenat et al. (2013)](http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-642-38721-0)
[State of the Art on Ontology Alignment, Vargas-Vera et al. 2015, paywall](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2807068)


For this, there are interlinking tools, like LIMES, the "Link Discovery Framework for Metric Spaces".
