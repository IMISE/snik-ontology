title: Interlinking SNIK subontologies with LIMES (Draft)

# Abstract
We used (LIMES)[http://aksw.org/Projects/LIMES.html] to find links between similar concepts in the SNIK subontologies.
110 exact label matches and 149 similar label matches.
Compared to the 80 existing manually created links, 62 were rediscovered as an exact match, 1 was rediscovered as an similar match, 17 were not found again, which leaves 48 new exact matches and 148 new similar matches.
The new links need manual verification and closeless rating through choosing between `skos:exactMatch`, `skos:closeMatch` and so on ([see SNIK wiki](https://wiki.imise.uni-leipzig.de/Projekte/SNIK/ontologie/extraktion/relationen)).

# Problem
The SNIK ontology consists of the central meta ontology and several subontologies.
While the meta ontology contains central terms that are used by nearly all subontologies, some terms are only used by several of them or they have slightly different meanings or are not central. 
In these cases, we modelled those terms as separate classes in each of the subontologies.

As the extractions are done by different people, the information, that those classes are related, was initially missing.
Identifying those relations, called interlinks, allows us at the SNIK project to compare linked concepts to find differences and similarities between the subontologies and thus the different textbook sources. 
After the SNIK project is finished and hopefully widely used, they enable integrating data from hospitals that use different subontologies.

At first, our domain experts manually created 80 links between the bb (blue book) and the ob (orange book) subontologies.
Next, we wanted to automatically generate further candidates, that is possibly related pairs of classes that have to be manually verified.



## Related Work
The task of interlinking has its roots in the database world, where it has a long tradition under the name of *record matching* with many relevant applications in integrating databases, for example between a library and a publisher.
Failure to achieve record matching can be disastrous.
For example, when hundreds of thousands of refugees came to Germany in 2015, different government institutions in different states didn't match their databases so that much of the registration work had to be repeated many times, resulting in long wait times, missing statistics and high costs ([German non-scientific source](http://www.wiwo.de/politik/deutschland/fluechtlingskrise-bundeslaender-machen-alle-ihr-eigenes-ding/12576060-2.html)).
Even worse, regionalism and data protection laws prevent a unified medical database, so that patients that are examined at one place may be examined again at another, leading to wasted time, money, impact on the patients health e.g. x ray radiation) and even deaths when cancer suspects cannot be inspected in time because the machines are blocked by other patient's unnecessary repeat examinations (no source, just speculation).
Of course, hospitals communicate with each other but sending latters is extremely ineffective as compared to a common database and information that is not asked for will never be sent while it could have been automatically be checked if, for example, the patient has an allergy to a certain medication.

In the context of the Semantic Web, this task is called (entity/data) (inter-)linking, instance matching, record linkage, data deduplication, entity reconciliation or coreference resolution ((source)[https://wiss.univ-st-etienne.fr/files/2015/09/wiss2015-euzenat.pdf]).
The task of interlinking can be seen as a subtask of ontology matching (also called ontology *alignment*), see [Ontology Matching, Euzenat et al. (2013)](http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-642-38721-0) and [State of the Art on Ontology Alignment, Vargas-Vera et al. 2015, (paywall)](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2807068).

For this, there are interlinking tools, like LIMES, the "Link Discovery Framework for Metric Spaces".
